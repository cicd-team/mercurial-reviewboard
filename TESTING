RUNNING TESTS

In order to run the plugin tests, run:

    python bootstrap.py ENV --no-site-packages
    ENV/bin/nosetests
    
TEST DATA

The test directory is structured like this:

  +-tests/  
    +-diffs/
    | +-<canonical diffs for testing>
    |
    +-repo_tars/
    | +-<tar files containing testing repositories>
    |
    +-repos/ (generated by test runner)
    | +-<expanded repo tars>
    |
    +-scripts/
    | +-<scripts that were used to create the diffs and repo tars>
    |
    +-<python scripts for unit and integration tests>
    
There is a package-level setup function in mercurial_reviewboard.tests.__init__
that will automatically recreate the repos directory for every test run.
Some tests use the diffs/ and repos/ data to exercise various aspects of the
tool.  When creating a new diff or repo for testing, place a shell script in the 
scripts directory with the appropriate logic and commit the script and 
the resulting diff or repo tar.
